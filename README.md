## Task 1: Technical Understanding and API Integration



### Instructions:

1. API Integration:
    - Check out the Gladia documentation [here](https://docs.gladia.io/chapters/get-started/pages/transcribe-audio) and [here](https://docs.gladia.io/api-reference/introduction)

    - Write a few lines of code (any language of your choice), using examples in
the documentation that:
        - Upload an audio file
        - Send the audio file to the transcription API
        - Display the transcribed text to the user

    - For displaying the transcribed text you can assume the existence of any
helper functions you want, just provide a description.
No need for a UI.

2. Technical Write-Up:
    - Write a brief technical guide for developers on how to generate a bullet
point summary of an audio file.




## Task 2: Customer Support Simulation



### Instructions:

Below are some mock customer support tickets. Each ticket will present a
common issue faced by our customers when using our transcription API.

For each ticket, provide a detailed response explaining the issue and steps to
resolve it.

Highlight any additional resources or documentation that would be helpful for the
customer.



### Mock Tickets:

1. **Ticket 1**: "I keep getting a 401 Unauthorized error when trying to access the
API."

2. **Ticket 2**: "I receive an error when trying some of my files: 413 file too large.
Why is that and what can I do?"

3. **Ticket 3**: "I'm seeing a significant delay in receiving the transcription results.
Is there a way to speed this up?"

4. **Ticket 4**: "Do you support Chinese?"

5. **Ticket 5**: "We received complaints from our customers about some very
inaccurate transcriptions yesterday, can you check what happened?"




## Task 3: Technical Documentation and Communication



### Instructions:

1. **Documentation Review**:
    - Review [this](https://docs.gladia.io/chapters/audio-intelligence/pages/audio%20to%20llm) documentation page
    - Identify any areas for improvement in terms of clarity, completeness, and
usability.
    - Provide a rewritten version of the section with your improvements. **Thereâ€™s no need to change the code sections.**



### Evaluation Criteria:

- **Technical Proficiency**: Ability to understand and work with APIs, orient in
documentation, problem-solving skills.

- **Customer Support Skills**: Clarity and helpfulness of support ticket responses,
ability to empathize with customers.

- **Communication and Documentation**: Quality and clarity of technical guide,
